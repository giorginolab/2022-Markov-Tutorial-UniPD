# Markov state model tutorial

Toni Giorgino (IBF-CNR), www.giorginolab.it, for Prof. Fuxreiter's course at the University of Padova.

To preview the notebooks' code "live" with results, open it in Google Colab (or locally).

The [Analysis for HTMD](https://software.acellera.com/docs/latest/htmd/userguide/analysing.html) page 
contains tutorials using actual large-scale simulation data and the HTMD library (note that it 
takes 30'-1h to install, download data, and run the analysis).

For different takes on the computation, see repositories with earlier editions of the class.
